# Pre-sail checklist
### Safety
- **Lifejackets** and harnesses for each crew member
- **Liferaft** - Check inspection date. Is it tied to ship or not? Make note either way. If not tied to ship it should be tied before inflating
- **Lifebuoy**: Review how to undo, and check line condition
- **EPIRB**: Visual check and battery check
- **Flares**: Check quantity, colour (red/white/orange) and expiry dates
- **Fire extinguishers/blankets**: Check access and expiry
- **First Aid Kit**: Check present and check type (A, B, C)
- **Torch**: or MOB light
### Outer ship condition
- **Hull**: Visual check of above water
- **Through-hulls**: Check & open and close all sea-cocks to make sure they move, and check for any corrosion or leaks
- **Hull-plugs**: Check that are present.
- **Bilge**: test manual, and if present, electric and automatic
- **Rudder**: steer wheel fully to left and right, listen and feel for anything wrong
- **Ladder**: For how to get out of water
- **Anchor**: Inspect anchor and chain for corrosion. Check windlass works, if present. Check if second anchor present
- **Sails**: 
	- Check for any halyard locks on mast - these are present so winch cleats are not holding weight/pressure of whole sail
	- Unfurl and furl first foot of both sails to make sure sheets are running well
- **Winches/Cleats**: Check they turn and lock correctly
### Engine
- **Check**:
	- Oil level
	- Coolant level (not when engine is hot)
	- Belts
	- Raw water intake
	- Fuel filter (should be full of green fuel, no clear water)
- **Start** engine and listen and observe - you want it to warm up before leaving anyway
- **Check water**: Make sure you hear and see water coming out from cooling system
### Electric
- **Batteries**: Check and look for corrosion
- **Levels**::
	- Lead Acid: 12.6/12.7 fully charged. 12.2 uncharged.
	- Lithium: 13.3/13.7 fully charged
### Comms and Navigation
- **Radio**: make test call on marina channel (not 16)
- **Navigation lights**: switch them all on and make sure they work
- **Navigation**: Check GPS, depth sounder, wind gauges
- **Charts**: Check they are onboard for sailing region
### Tool and Repairs
- **Tools**: Check if onboard
- **Spare parts**: See what's available
### Supplies
- **Fuel**: Check tanks. If long journey, check backup jerry cans.
- **Water**: Fill water to full from port supply
- **Holding tank**: Check empty, and check valves are open.
### Documentation
- **Ship Papers**:
	- Registration
	- Insurance
	- Radio license/CE certification (only if going abroad)/Tax
- **Crew Passports/IDs**: required for all port visits
### Crew briefing
- **MOB**: Remind potential severity, brief on procedure. Brief on lifejacket and harness use, maybe mandatory in high seas
- **Collisions**: Remind potential severity/embarrassment; brief on how long a boat takes to sink
- **Emergency to captain**: Brief of use of channel 16
- **Sea-sickness**: Remind to take pills now
- **Watch**: 
	- If required, organise rotas and roles. 
	- Decide before leaving port to allow crew to prepare mentally.
	- Set rules for watch:
		- Starts on the minute - you must be on-deck, dressed, and awake
		- Suggest setting alarms for 15 mins before start
		- If calm seas, suggest outgoing watch offers to start making tea/coffee
		- Outgoing watch should brief new watch member on transfer
- **Food/Drink**: Make sure all crew has sufficient
# Leaving dock
- **Check wind speed and direction**: sailing vessels have masts that are above port walls. Where will the ship blow to if unmoored?
- **Look for tightest mooring line**: This will get untied first
- **Start engine**: Start early to allow time to warm up. Check it sounds right and water is coming out of cooling system
- **Release bow line**
- **Release other lines slackest to tightest
- **Engage gear and drive away**

# Raising sails
- **Mainsail**: 
	- Check wind strength and decide on any reefing; better be cautious while still under engine power
	- Ensure main sheet is tight and main track is centred
	- Check no tangles in furling halyard
	- Raise main sail while engine is still on
	- Adjust main sail to correct angle for wind
- **Jibsail**
	- Check furling halyard cleat on leeward side is open
	- Tidy furling halyard to ensure it runs smoothly
	- Hoist jib sail and hawee the lads
	- Turn engine off once both sails are up and at correct angle

# Sailing

### Raising 
### General sail positioning
- **Close-hauled**: Main at around 15-20ish degrees; jib should be super tight on the winch, with clew *inside* of the safety rails
- **Beam reach**: Main at around 30-40 degrees; jib clew hovering above safety rails
- **Broad reach**: Main out as far as it can get; jib out beyond safety rails so it's catching as much wind as possible.
### Mainsail Traveller 
- **When to use it?**: When close-hauled or on a close reach.
- **What is it?**:  A track that allows to change angle of pull (and thus keep sail shape) without adjust tension on main sheet
- **Why use it?**: In stronger winds on a close-haul, the boat will heel over uncomfortably. Sheeting out will reduce heel but also cause the *boom to rise*,   losing sail power and speed. By adjusting the traveller to leeward, you *spill wind from the **bottom** of sail* (so the boat heels less), but you *keep leach tension* to keep the sail full of wind. 
- **How to use it?**:
	- **Super slight winds**: Lift traveller to windward - keeping boom on centerline with low sheet tension
	- **Light winds (<8kn)**: Keep it in the middle (centerline), and keep sheet relatively loose to allow sail to fill
	- **Moderate winds (or light + gusts) (8-15kn)**: Think about adjusting to leeward, tighten sheet a bit
	- **Strong winds (>15kn)**: Move traveller to leeward, keep sheet tight.
- **Downwind**: Chuck the traveller fully out to leeward, but it won't do much. More important is mainsheet right out and boom vang super tight to pull sail down
### Vang
- **What is it?**: The vang pulls down on the boom to stop it from raising. 
- **Why use it?**:  When the boom rises, the mainsail spills wind at the top. This reduces weather helm (boat turning to wind). 
- **When to use it?**: On a close-haul and if there is strong weather helm, consider loosening the vang - this will keep the bulk of the sail full. *But don't get cocky - if the vang doesn't work then reef!*
- **Opposites**: Think of the vang as the opposite of the traveller:
	- A loose traveller spills wind from the *bottom* of the sail, reducing heel
	- A loose vang spills wind from the *top* of the sail, reducing weather helm
- **Reefing in**
