Slide 15: The flow wasn't clear to me upon first reading - only when I saw the numbers did it begin to make sense. I wonder if reversing the slide to go top-down would help? Maybe make the numbering bigger? Also maybe draw horizontal lines/bands from the categories on the LHS? 

General comments on the modules: The images on the right of the 'second slide' for each module, are difficult to understand without reading the left hand side text in detail (the text in them is very small). Maybe number them and cross-reference them in the text?

Module 5: I like that there are lots of buzzwords here, but when giving the session I would actually tie everything "back to basics" wrt internet communication. Maybe we can reference a single example use-case and thread all new concepts back to that one, throughout all the modules? People like an analogy!
