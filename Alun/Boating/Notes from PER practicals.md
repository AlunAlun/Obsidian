# Pre-sail checklist
### Safety
- **Lifejackets** and harnesses for each crew member
- **Liferaft** - Check inspection date. Is it tied to ship or not? Make note either way. If not tied to ship it should be tied before inflating
- **Lifebuoy**: Review how to undo, and check line condition
- **EPIRB**: Visual check and battery check
- **Flares**: Check quantity, colour (red/white/orange) and expiry dates
- **Fire extinguishers/blankets**: Check access and expiry
- **First Aid Kit**: Check present and check type (A, B, C)

### Outer ship condition
- **Hull**: Visual check of above water
- **Through-hulls**: Check & open and close all sea-cocks to make sure they move, and check for any corrosion or leaks
- **Hull-plugs**: Check that are present.
- **Bilge**: test manual, and if present, electric and automatic
- **Rudder**: steer wheel fully to left and right, listen and feel for anything wrong
- **Ladder**: For how to get out of water


### Engine
- **Check**:
	- Oil level
	- Coolant level (not when engine is hot)
	- Belts
	- Raw water intake
	- Fuel filter (should be full of green fuel, no clear water)
- **Start** engine and listen and observe - you want it to warm up before leaving anyway

### Electric
- **Batteries**: Check and look for corrosion
- **Levels**::
	- Lead Acid: 12.6/12.7 fully charged. 12.2 uncharged.
	- Lithium: 13.3/13.7 fully charged

### Comms and Navigation
- **Radio**: make test call on marina channel (not 16)
- **Navigation lights**: switch them all on and make sure they work
- **Navigation**: Check GPS, depth sounder, wind gauges
- **Charts**: Check they are onboard for sailing region
