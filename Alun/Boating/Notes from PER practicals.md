# Pre-sail checklist
### Safety
- Check **lifejackets** and harnesses
- **Liferaft** - it is tied to ship or not? Make note either way. If not tied to ship it should be tied before inflating.
- Review how to undo **life-buoy** and check line condition

### Outer ship condition
- Visual check of above water **hull**
- Check **through-hulls** - open and close all sea-cocks to make sure they move, and check for any corrosion or leaks
- **Bilge** - test manual, and if present, electric and automatic
- **Rudder** - steer wheel fully to left and right, listen and feel for anything wrong

### Propulsion and Electric
- Check **engine**:
	- Oil level
	- Coolant level (not when engine is hot)
	- Belts
	- Raw water intake
	- Fuel filter (should be full of green fuel, no clear water)
- Start engine and listen and observe - you want it to warm up before leaving
