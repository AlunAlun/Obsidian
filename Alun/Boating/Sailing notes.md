# Pre-sail checklist
### Safety
- **Lifejackets** and harnesses for each crew member
- **Liferaft** - Check inspection date. Is it tied to ship or not? Make note either way. If not tied to ship it should be tied before inflating
- **Lifebuoy**: Review how to undo, and check line condition
- **EPIRB**: Visual check and battery check
- **Flares**: Check quantity, colour (red/white/orange) and expiry dates
- **Fire extinguishers/blankets**: Check access and expiry
- **First Aid Kit**: Check present and check type (A, B, C)
- **Torch**: or MOB light
### Outer ship condition
- **Hull**: Visual check of above water
- **Through-hulls**: Check & open and close all sea-cocks to make sure they move, and check for any corrosion or leaks
- **Hull-plugs**: Check that are present.
- **Bilge**: test manual, and if present, electric and automatic
- **Rudder**: steer wheel fully to left and right, listen and feel for anything wrong
- **Ladder**: For how to get out of water
- **Anchor**: Inspect anchor and chain for corrosion. Check windlass works, if present. Check if second anchor present
- **Sails**: 
	- Check for any halyard locks on mast - these are present so winch cleats are not holding weight/pressure of whole sail
	- Unfurl and furl first foot of both sails to make sure sheets are running well
- **Winches/Cleats**: Check they turn and lock correctly
### Engine
- **Check**:
	- Oil level
	- Coolant level (not when engine is hot)
	- Belts
	- Raw water intake
	- Fuel filter (should be full of green fuel, no clear water)
- **Start** engine and listen and observe - you want it to warm up before leaving anyway
- **Check water**: Make sure you hear and see water coming out from cooling system
### Electric
- **Batteries**: Check and look for corrosion
- **Levels**::
	- Lead Acid: 12.6/12.7 fully charged. 12.2 uncharged.
	- Lithium: 13.3/13.7 fully charged
### Comms and Navigation
- **Radio**: make test call on marina channel (not 16)
- **Navigation lights**: switch them all on and make sure they work
- **Navigation**: Check GPS, depth sounder, wind gauges
- **Charts**: Check they are onboard for sailing region
### Tool and Repairs
- **Tools**: Check if onboard
- **Spare parts**: See what's available
### Supplies
- **Fuel**: Check tanks. If long journey, check backup jerry cans.
- **Water**: Fill water to full from port supply
- **Holding tank**: Check empty, and check valves are open.
### Documentation
- **Ship Papers**:
	- Registration
	- Insurance
	- Radio license/CE certification (only if going abroad)/Tax
- **Crew Passports/IDs**: required for all port visits
### Crew briefing
- **MOB**: Remind potential severity, brief on procedure. Brief on lifejacket and harness use, maybe mandatory in high seas
- **Collisions**: Remind potential severity/embarrassment; brief on how long a boat takes to sink
- **Emergency to captain**: Brief of use of channel 16
- **Sea-sickness**: Remind to take pills now
- **Watch**: 
	- If required, organise rotas and roles. 
	- Decide before leaving port to allow crew to prepare mentally.
	- Set rules for watch:
		- Starts on the minute - you must be on-deck, dressed, and awake
		- Suggest setting alarms for 15 mins before start
		- If calm seas, suggest outgoing watch offers to start making tea/coffee
		- Outgoing watch should brief new watch member on transfer
- **Food/Drink**: Make sure all crew has sufficient
# Preparing the boat
- **Weather**: look at the forecast to see wind and wave conditions
	- >7kn + >12kn gusts, small waves: big headsail, no reefs in main
	- More than that, consider a smaller headsail and/or reefs. It's easier to let out a reef in calm conditions that vice-versa
- **Headsail**: 
	- Unfold on deck and attach the tack to the bow at it's lowest point
	- Unclip the halyard from the mast, hold on to it and attach it to the head of the sail. Make sure halyards are not twisted!
	- Thread the sail through the metal guides, then start threading through the forestay guide
	- Find the mid-point of the headsail sheet and cows-tail it through the clew.
	- Tie figure-8s in end of sheets
	- Run both sides of the sheets around the shrounds (if the clew reaches beyond them), through the pulleys, and coil tidily in cockpit
	- Check *topping lift* (line from top of mast to boom) tension
- **Mainsail**: 
	- Unzip completely the lazybag
	- On both sides of the mast, loosen the lazyjacks to relax the lazy-bag. Retie the lazyjacks
	- Ensure the sail slugs on the luff of the mainsail are in their tracks. If leaving with a reef, make sure to clip the relevant reef batten to bottom of main sail
- **Lines and prep**:
	- **Left** is usually the halyards.
	- **Right**: *Reefing lines, boom vang, etc.*: make sure they are loose and can move easily - throw them below deck
	- **Furling lines**: if using a roller head sail, make sure furling lines are loose
	- **Tidy and check**: all lines!
	- **Boathook**: Put somewhere handy.
- **Outboard**:
	- Release and lower into water
	- Fill with fuel
	- Open fuel air screw
	- Open llave de paso - check cos it might go to rear (counter-clockwise)
	- Put into neutral
	- Insert deadman
	- Lower accelerator and put just above idle
	- Pull out slowly til feel resistance, then give it all
	- Check water coming out of engine

# Leaving port
- **Check wind speed and direction**: sailing vessels have masts that are above port walls. Where will the ship blow to if unmoored?
- **Look for tightest mooring line**: This will get untied first
- **Start engine**: Start early to allow time to warm up. Check it sounds right and water is coming out of cooling system
- **CHECK FOR TRAFFIC!**
- **Release lines**: dead lines first, the dock, slackest to tightest
- **Move away**
	- If facing forward just pull away
	- If facing backwards, reverse slowly out to clear before turning full
- **Through the port**: Stay upwind if possible to give you time to react if engine failure
# Raising sails
- **Mainsail**: 
	- Check wind strength and decide on any reefing; better be cautious while still under engine power
	- Ensure main sheet is tight and main track is centred
	- Check no tangles in furling halyard
	- Raise main sail while engine is still on
	- Adjust main sail to correct angle for wind
	- Loosen *Topping Lift* because the main sail is taking the weight of the boom now
- **Jibsail**
	- Check furling halyard cleat on leeward side is open
	- Tidy furling halyard to ensure it runs smoothly
	- Hoist jib sail and hawee the lads
	- Turn engine off once both sails are up and at correct angle

# Sailing

### General sail positioning
- **Close-hauled**: Main at around 15-20ish degrees; jib should be super tight on the winch, with clew *inside* of the safety rails
- **Beam reach**: Main at around 30-40 degrees; jib clew hovering above safety rails
- **Broad reach**: 
	- Main out as far as it can get; 
	- jib out beyond safety rails so it's catching as much wind as possible BUT make sure it's not getting *ahead* of forestay! 
	- Traveller way out
	- Loosen *Topping lift* to allow boom to fall as much as possible
	- Tighten *Boom vang* to pull boom down as much as possible
### Mainsail Traveller 
- **What is it?**:  A track that allows to change angle of pull (and thus keep sail shape) without adjust tension on main sheet
- **Close haul use**: In stronger winds on a close-haul, the boat will heel over uncomfortably. Sheeting out will reduce heel but also cause the *boom to rise*,   losing sail power and speed. By adjusting the traveller to leeward, you *spill wind from the **bottom** of sail* (so the boat heels less), but you *keep leach tension* to keep the sail full of wind. 
- **How to use it?**:
	- **Super slight winds**: Lift traveller to windward - keeping boom on centerline with low sheet tension
	- **Light winds (<8kn)**: Keep it in the middle (centerline), and keep sheet relatively loose to allow sail to fill
	- **Moderate winds (or light + gusts) (8-15kn)**: Think about adjusting to leeward, tighten sheet a bit
	- **Strong winds (>15kn)**: Move traveller to leeward, keep sheet tight.
- **Downwind**: Chuck the traveller fully out to leeward, but it won't do much. More important is mainsheet right out and boom vang super tight to pull sail down
### Vang
- **What is it?**: The vang pulls down on the boom to stop it from raising. 
- **Why use it?**:  When the boom rises, the mainsail spills wind at the top. This reduces weather helm (boat turning to wind). 
- **When to use it?**: On a close-haul and if there is strong weather helm, consider loosening the vang - this will keep the bulk of the sail full. *But don't get cocky - if the vang doesn't work then reef!*
- **Opposites**: Think of the vang as the opposite of the traveller:
	- A loose traveller spills wind from the *bottom* of the sail, reducing heel
	- A loose vang spills wind from the *top* of the sail, reducing weather helm
- **Reefing instead**: if loosening the vang doesn't do much to weather helm, you need to reef!
### Reefing
- **As soon as you start considering it, do it**
- **Which sail to reef first?**:  This depends on the boat
	- *Weather helm (turning to wind)*: reefing the main
	- *Lee helm (turning downwind)*: reef the headsail
- **Reefing the mainsail is usually harder**: in storm conditions, reef the mainsail while you can, rolling a roller headsail can be done from the cockpit
### Furling sails
- **Direction**: Turn into wind and get in irons (10-20 degrees)
- **Engine**: Turn on and put into low forward gear
- **Roller Headsail**: 
	- Release the leeward sheet completely
	- Pull furling line while keeping tension on windward sheet (difficult if no crew)
	- Cleat off furling line
- **Regular headsail**:
	- On smaller yacht, cleat halyard to *mast cleat*. Loosen cockpit cleat
	- Leave halyard loose and organised
	- Loosen mast cleat and control while pulling sail down - do not allow to fall into water
	- Pull sail from *bottom* (below metal guides) - this allows quick raising in emergency
- **Mainsail**:
	- Roller mast:uUncleat furling line (check if extra cleat on mast)
	- Pull furling line while keeping tension on sheet to ensure clean roll
# Tacking
- **Prepare**: 
	- ensure downwind sheet is tidy and ready to release
	- ensure upwind sheet is ready to pull
	- don't move *traveller* quite yet as this may increase heel in strong wind? But make it priority to move asap after tack
- **Tacking**:
	- Announce etc.
	- Keep your head low
	- Move helm gently to new bearing, it will want to continue going that way
	- *Wait for headsail to luff*
	- Release tight sheet, and wait for wind to push sail to other side
	- Pull new downwind sheet to trim sail
	- Correct helm
	- Correct traveller asap
	- Ride away clean
# Gybing
- **Prepare**
	- Pull mainsail into close-haul position
	- Move traveller to center
	- Sort sheets, same as for tacking
	- Move helm gently to new bearing
	- *Grab main sheet if possible to smooth the boom gybe*
	- Release and tighten sheets as for tacking
	- Set sails for broad reach, ride away clean
# Anchoring
### Chain length and position
- **Do a lap of the anchorage**: to check depth. Prioritize protection from waves more than wind
- **5/1 ratio doesn't include keel**: You should assume keel is 3ish metres below the deck. So if anchored in 3m of depth (from base of keel) you need to let out (3+3) * 5 = 30m of chain. Go to 6:1 for chain and rope. 
- **Drop anchor astern and to side of other boat**: Try not to drop right beside them
### Dropping anchor
- **Drop anchor process**:
	- Turn bow to wind
	- Turn on windlass
	- Untie anchor safety line
	- Get anchor just off and ready to go
	- Drop anchor
	- In light conditions, may need to reverse slowly: *you want chain flat on seabed, not in a pile*
	- Count marks on chain as they go by to measure chain
- **Attach snubber**: when correct amount of chain is out, attach snubber to absorb tension and take weight off windlass
- **Engage reverse**: 
	- Slow to start until chain is tight
	- Test at increasing rpm: 1000, 1200, then 1500rpm (simulates a 40-50kt gust)
	- Pick a line-up on land to see if you're holding
	- Put foot on chain - can feel vibrations if anchor is dragging
- **Swim and check on anchor**: if clear and warm enough!
- **Hang out on boat for a 30-60 mins**: to check all is good
### Weighing anchor
- **Start engine**: electric windlass use a lot of power
- **Motor ahead**: to take load of winch
- **If anchor stuck, try:**
	- a direct pull from above
	- motor ahead to pull anchor from different angle
	-
